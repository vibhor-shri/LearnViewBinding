Basics of view binding in Android


View binding provides the ability to bind views to either activities or fragments in android. If viewBinding is set to true for any project in android, a binding class is generated automatically after compiliation, and creates references for the view to be used in activity or fragments. They also get rid of the findViewById() operation in android which was expensive to look up everytime, especially in a complex layout.
